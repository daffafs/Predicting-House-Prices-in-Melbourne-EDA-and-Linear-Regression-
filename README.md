# Poject Problem
The increase in the rate of population growth causes the need for housing to increase because it is a primary need for everyone. Currently, many companies are engaged in buying and selling land, buildings, houses, etc. Someone who wants to buy a house certainly doesn't want to buy a house at the wrong price. Real estate companies when buying houses for resale also don't want to get the wrong purchase price because it can be detrimental to the company. To set a good purchase price, an analysis of the factors that influence property prices is required. Price predictions based on location and residence specifications are also very useful for setting purchase prices. Therefore, this project created a machine learning prediction model using linear regression to help a person or company buy property at the right price.

# Project Goal
The goal of this project are:
1. Extract, explore, analyze, and visualize data
2. Make a prediction of house prices using a linear regression model
3. Imputing missing values and encoding categorical features
4. Improve model performance by reducing overfitting
5. Evaluating the prediction model using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

This project consists of three parts:
1. Prepare Data
    - Import
    - Explore
    - Analysis
    - Split
2. Build the Model
    - Baseline
    - Iteration
    - Evaluation
3. Communication Results
    - Testing
